#Assuming currency in United States Dollar
#Process I follow for data analysis: - Created a table with the dataset you provided in Google BigQuery. And run SQL queries
for data retrieval. Data contains null values in many fields, which can be ignored, or default values can be provided, e.g., 0, "-".
But null values are less than 1% of the data. That's why this will not impact overall results. So I proceed with null values.
